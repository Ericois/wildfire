# Wildfire Tracker
## Description
Wildfire Compass is a React dashboard built to help people stay informed about current fires in California. It provides real-time data on active fires, air quality, and other critical information. 

## APIs
Wildfire Compass is built using modern web technologies including React for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Vite for the build tool. The application leverages several APIs to provide real-time data, including NASA FIRMS for fire data, OpenWeather for air quality, News API for the latest news updates and BlueSky for social media updates. The live fire mapping feature is powered by Mapbox, which displays a heatmap of fire locations based on data pulled regularly from NASA FIRMS.
